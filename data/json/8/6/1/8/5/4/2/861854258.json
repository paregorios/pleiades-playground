The whole site is delimited to the north by the escarpment, \r\nwhich\r\ndramatically divides the Dakhla Oasis from the desert plateau, and to \r\nthe east,\r\nsouth, and west by cultivated fields and patches of desert land.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The site (<strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4546049510/in/set-72157623870963450/\">map</a></strong>) consists of five low hills,\r\nof which mound I, centrally located, is the largest, covering an area of\r\n about\r\none-half hectare (<strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4546049444/in/set-72157623870963450/\">plan</a></strong>). Three smaller mounds (II-IV) lie to the south and \r\nsouthwest\r\nof mound I, while mound V is located about 230 m to the northeast.\r\nArchaeological remains of mud-brick structures were identified on all \r\nfive\r\nmounds, but excavation was carried out only on mound I.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The\r\nDakhleh Oasis Project conducted a preliminary survey of the site in \r\n1980, and\r\nthe local Coptic and Islamic Inspectorate carried out three seasons of\r\nexcavation between 1993 and 1995. The investigation focused on the <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526708898/in/set-72157623870963450/\">south\r\n half</a></strong>\r\non mound I and revealed a very intricate complex of <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526708992/in/set-72157623870963450/\"><strong>rooms</strong></a> (several \r\nidentifiable\r\nas magazines), surrounding a large, open-air central <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526078349/in/set-72157623870963450/\">kitchen</a></strong>. The area \r\nshowed\r\nclear evidence of a multi-phased development, with the addition of \r\nclusters of\r\nrooms built against earlier ones and extending to the outer edges of the\r\n mound.\r\nA Columbia University team, with Nicola Aravecchia as field director, \r\nexcavated\r\non the main hill from 2006 until 2008.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">In\r\nthe northern half of the mound, sets of interconnected rooms, sometimes \r\nopening\r\nonto apparent inner courtyards, were built against each other to form \r\nlarger,\r\nroughly rectangular blocks, divided by a network of roughly \r\nperpendicular\r\nstreets. Three interconnected <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526078579/in/set-72157623870963450/\">rooms</a></strong> (B1-3) were excavated, <em>i.e.</em>, \r\ntwo\r\nroughly square, symmetrical spaces opening onto a rectangular court \r\n(with two\r\nother–unexcavated–rooms built against the opposite side of the \r\ncourtyard, for a\r\ntotal of five spaces). Archaeological investigation points to the\r\nidentification of this sector as a residential area. A remarkably large\r\nstructure was also surveyed along the north end of mound I, consisting \r\nof two\r\nrectangular rooms located at the center of a wide, rectangular court (<em>ca.</em>\r\n16 m north-south by 12 m east-west). The complex was likely a pigeon \r\ntower, a\r\ncommon feature in the oasis landscape.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The central part of the hill\r\nreflects a more irregular arrangement, which might be the result of a \r\nless\r\nplanned, multi-phased rearrangement of space. A church complex is \r\nlocated in\r\nthe middle of the mound. The church (B5) (<strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526076627/in/set-72157623870963450/\">plan</a></strong>) consists of a one-nave <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526707634/in/set-72157623870963450/\">room</a></strong>,\r\noriginally barrel-vaulted; it is oriented to the east and ends with a \r\nround\r\napse and L-shaped <em>pastophorion</em>, both added at a later time \r\nagainst the\r\neast wall. Mud-brick benches run along the north, west, and south walls \r\nof this\r\nroom, which was originally accessible from the north through two \r\ndoorways, one\r\nnear the northwest corner and a large opening in the middle of the north\r\n side.\r\nThese connected the nave with a large, rectangular <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526707816/in/set-72157623870963450/\">hall</a></strong> (A46), a space\r\noriginally covered by a barrel-vaulted roof and with benches built along\r\n the\r\nnorth, east, and south walls. Against the south side of the central \r\npassageway\r\nis a stepped mud-brick <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526075551/in/set-72157623870963450/\">podium</a></strong>, accessible only from the church, that \r\nonce\r\ngranted people in both rooms the possibility to see and hear the person\r\nstanding on the podium. At some point, this passageway was closed and \r\nthe\r\npodium eliminated. The gathering hall opens to the north onto a smaller,\r\nbarrel-vaulted rectangular <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526706332/in/set-72157623870963450/\">space</a></strong> (B6), which was used, at least in its \r\nlatest\r\noccupational phase, for the preparation of food; indeed, a hearth with \r\ntraces\r\nof ash and charcoal was found against a low, rectangular platform along \r\nthe\r\nnorth wall. Also, imprints of jars are visible on a raised platform \r\nagainst the\r\neast wall and along the south wall of the room at floor level. Some <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526706688/in/set-72157623870963450/\">\r\n<strong>graffiti</strong></a>\r\ncan be seen on the west and north walls, including two inscriptions–one \r\nin\r\nGreek and the other in Coptic–and some drawings such as boats and a \r\nbird. This\r\nanteroom is accessed from a long <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526706848/in/set-72157623870963450/\">corridor</a></strong> (B7) running east-west to the \r\nnorth\r\nof the gathering hall. This space, which seems to have been roofless, \r\nends to\r\nthe east with a <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526076191/in/set-72157623870963450/\">doorway</a></strong> that is the only entrance into the church \r\ncomplex from\r\nthe outside. A narrow, vaulted <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526708006/in/set-72157623870963450/\">passageway</a></strong> connects the anteroom with \r\nanother\r\n<strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526707168/in/set-72157623870963450/\">space</a></strong> to the north (B9). A mud-brick recessed feature, possibly used as a\r\n<strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526076553/in/set-72157623870963450/\">cupboard</a></strong> in antiquity, is set in the south wall of this room, by its \r\nsoutheast\r\ncorner. It is possible that this space, which did not open onto any \r\nother room\r\nbesides anteroom B6 to the south, was used as a magazine for the latter.\r\n A\r\ndoorway located in the northeast corner of the anteroom opens onto a\r\nwell-preserved <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526076283/in/set-72157623870963450/\">staircase</a></strong> (B8), which led to the roof of a <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526077425/in/set-72157623870963450/\">kitchen</a></strong> (B10).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">A\r\nlong <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526077541/in/set-72157623870963450/\">street</a></strong> (B12) runs from north to south along the east side of the \r\ncomplex.\r\nIt consists of three different sectors, which were part of a longer \r\nstreet\r\nrunning from north to south across the hill. A small open-air area \r\n(B14-15),\r\nwith evidence of several bread ovens, once opened onto this street near \r\nthe\r\nmain entrance of the complex. Another <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526708560/in/set-72157623870963450/\">passageway</a></strong> (B11), which was \r\noriginally\r\nbarrel-vaulted, runs east-west along the south wall of the church and\r\nintersects the north-south street at its east end, where an open <strong>\r\n<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526077851/in/set-72157623870963450/\">courtyard</a></strong>\r\n(B13) is located. Two clay and mud-brick rectangular features, possibly\r\nassociated with the feeding of animals, are built against the south wall\r\n of\r\nthis crossroads.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">A\r\nconsiderable amount of data proves the existence of different phases of\r\nconstruction within the church complex, including the south wall of the \r\nchurch\r\n(irregularly laid out and clearly built in different phases), the \r\nsemi-circular\r\napse with L-shaped <em>pastophorion</em> (added at a later stage), and the\r\nmud-brick wall blocking the podium. Furthermore, foundation walls in the\r\n church\r\nand the hall to the north belong either to previous buildings or to \r\nearlier\r\nconstruction phases of the complex. The available evidence suggests that\r\n three\r\nsmaller rooms originally stood in the area later occupied by the church,\r\n the\r\ngathering hall, and the anteroom. The walls of these early structures \r\nwere\r\neither razed or incorporated within the walls of the church complex, \r\nwhich was\r\nextended to the west and northwest, but also to the east with the \r\naddition of\r\nthe apse and <em>pastophorion</em>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The\r\nclosest parallel to the plan of the church of Ain el-Gedida is the Small\r\n East\r\nChurch of Kellis. The church, excavated by Gillian Bowen, has comparable\r\ndimensions and construction material and has a significantly \r\nsimilar–although\r\nnot identical–layout, with a large rectangular space opening to the \r\nsouth into\r\nan apsidal room through two doorways, a smaller one to the west and a \r\nwider\r\npassage in the middle. The dating, which is based mainly on coins, is\r\nconsistent with that of the church complex at Ain el-Gedida.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">About\r\n25 m to the northwest of the church, and lying along the western edge of\r\n mound\r\nI, near the cultivated fields, is a large, rectangular complex of eight \r\nrooms\r\n(B17-24) (<strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526077899/in/set-72157623870963450/\">plan</a></strong>). It measures 18.50 m north-south by 7.10 m east-west and \r\nconsists of\r\nan extensive courtyard with niched walls to the west and east (only the \r\nniches\r\nof the east wall are partially preserved); to the north of the courtyard\r\n (which\r\nwas later partitioned into different rooms) is a set of two very small \r\nrooms\r\n(B20-21), opening onto each other, flanked by two rectangular side-rooms\r\n(B22-23). The complex can be identified as originally a small-scale \r\nmud-brick\r\ntemple, converted into a <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526708820/in/set-72157623870963450/\">ceramic workshop</a></strong> in Late Antiquity. Indeed, \r\nseveral\r\npieces of unfired pottery were collected during the excavations, \r\ntogether with\r\nlarge lumps of clay and the extensive remains of clay (or clay and \r\nstone) bins\r\nembedded in the floor. To the east of the complex is a rectangular <strong><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4526076359/in/set-72157623870963450/\">space</a></strong>\r\n (B4)\r\nthat contained a large quantity of ash, charcoal, organic material, \r\nbroken\r\nobjects, and pottery sherds. This evidence suggests that the space was \r\nused, at\r\nleast in its latest phase, as a domestic midden.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">All\r\nbuildings excavated or surveyed at Ain el-Gedida have walls built of \r\nsun-dried\r\nmud-bricks, rich in organic inclusions. Their dimensions fit the \r\nstandard\r\nmeasures of Roman samples, which were generally adopted in Coptic \r\narchitecture.\r\nThe bricks used to build the vaulted ceilings are of a larger size. \r\nStone was\r\nrarely used at Ain el-Gedida, mostly for the lintels of doorways. No \r\nwooden\r\nfeature was found <em>in situ</em>; however, wood was certainly used as a\r\nbuilding material, especially for doorways and shelves.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The\r\nmaterial evidence from Ain el-Gedida includes ceramics, lamps, ostraka, \r\ncoins,\r\nwood and metal (especially bronze) objects, dull glass jewels, and items\r\n made\r\nof vegetal fibers. Pottery is the largest category of finds retrieved on\r\n site,\r\nincluding thousands of fragments and a few complete or almost complete \r\nvessels.\r\nThe ceramic corpus can be assigned to a period spanning from the early fourth to \r\nthe beginning\r\nof the fifth century CE, with very few exceptions. The readable coins \r\nfrom the\r\nsite largely confirm this chronology; most are from the fourth century \r\nCE, and\r\nmainly from the first half of the century. Significant evidence for an \r\nearlier\r\nchronology than the fourth-early fifth century CE was provided by the \r\ndiscovery\r\nof the mud-brick temple near the west edge of mound I. This complex \r\ntestifies\r\nto the existence of the settlement since probably the second century CE.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The\r\narchaeological record has not provided any evidence suggesting episodes \r\nof\r\nviolent destruction or abrupt abandonment. No objects of significant \r\nvalue were\r\nfound in the rooms that were excavated.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Ain\r\nel-Gedida was preliminarily identified, since the time of the first \r\nsurvey and\r\nof the SCA excavations in the mid-1990s, as a rural village or monastic\r\nsettlement. One reason stimulating the latter interpretation is the \r\nclustered\r\nconfiguration of the south part of the main hill, with a large kitchen\r\ncentrally placed. This was seen as typical of a spatial arrangement \r\nmeant to\r\nsatisfy the needs of people who lived a communal life, rather than being\r\ndivided into standard families. But the site as a whole was certainly \r\nnot\r\nmonastic. It may have been an <em>epoikion</em>, that is to say, an \r\nagricultural\r\nsettlement with wage or tenant labor, quite possibly seasonal, dependent\r\n on\r\nKellis–of a type largely attested in documentary sources but never fully\r\ndocumented by excavation.</p>\r\n<p align=\"right\" class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Nicola Aravecchia</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">&nbsp;<strong>SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Aravecchia, \r\nNicola\r\n(forthcoming). “The Church Complex of Ain el-Gedida, Dakhleh Oasis.” \r\n(Acts of\r\nthe 6th International Dakhleh Oasis Project Conference – Lecce, \r\nSeptember\r\n20-24, 2009).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">– \r\n(forthcoming). “Ain\r\nel-Gedida: Results from the 2006 Field Season.” (Acts of the 5th \r\nInternational\r\nDakhleh Oasis Project Conference – Cairo, June 3-6, 2006).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">– (2010).&nbsp; \r\n“Ain el-Gedida\r\n2010 Study Season: Field Director’s Report.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">http://www.amheida.org/inc/pdf/Report2010AG.pdf</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">&nbsp;– (2009a). <em>Christians\r\nof\r\n the Western Desert in Late Antiquity: The Fourth-Century Church Complex\r\n of\r\nAin el-Gedida, Upper Egypt.</em> Ph.D. Dissertation, University of \r\nMinnesota.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">– (2009b).&nbsp; \r\n“Ain\r\nel-Gedida 2009 Study Season: Field Director’s Report.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">http://www.amheida.org/inc/pdf/Report2009AG.pdf</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">–\r\n(2008). “Ain el-Gedida 2008 Excavations: Field Director’s Report.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">http://www.amheida.org/inc/pdf/Report2008AG.pdf</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">–\r\n(2007). “Ain el-Gedida 2007 Excavations: Field Director’s Report.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">http://www.amheida.org/inc/pdf/Report2007AG.pdf</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">–\r\n(2006). “Ain el-Gedida 2006 Excavations: Field Director’s Report.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">http://www.amheida.org/inc/pdf/Report2006AG.pdf</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Bagnall, Roger\r\n S., and\r\nDominic W.
